# Customer_Churn_Prediction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting customer churn, i.e., the likelihood of a customer discontinuing their relationship with a business. By identifying customers at risk of churning, businesses can implement targeted retention strategies to minimize customer loss.
