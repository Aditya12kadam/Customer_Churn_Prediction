# Customer_Churn_Prediction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting customer churn, i.e., the likelihood of a customer discontinuing their relationship with a business. By identifying customers at risk of churning, businesses can implement targeted retention strategies to minimize customer loss.

Methodology

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Summarize key insights from EDA, including visualizations and statistical summaries.
    Model Selection: Selected Four Classification Algorithms i.e SVC,DecisionTressClassifier,Logistic Regression, ANN .
    Model Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC curve etc.
Dependencies

    Required libraries: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib,Seaborn,Tensorflow etc.
